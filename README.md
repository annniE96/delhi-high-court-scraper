# Delhi High Court Case Data Fetcher

A web application that fetches case information from the Delhi High Court's website and provides a user-friendly interface to search and view case details.

This project features a **dual-scraper system**‚Äîdefaulting to a stable mock data mode for demonstration, while also including a fully implemented live scraper showcasing advanced browser automation and CAPTCHA-solving techniques.

## üîß Sample Environment Variables

While not required to run locally, using a `.env` file is recommended for production:

```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-strong-and-random-secret-key

# Scraping Configuration
# Set to "False" to enable the live scraper, "True" for mock data (default)
USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=True
```

## üõ°Ô∏è CAPTCHA Handling Strategy

The application includes a dual-scraper system to ensure reliability and demonstrate a robust approach to live web scraping.

### 1. **Mock Scraper (Default Mode)**

- Uses a curated set of realistic case data in `sample_data.py`.
- Guarantees a stable, fast, and reliable user experience.
- Demonstrates core features (UI, database, PDF generation) without unpredictability of the live website.

### 2. **Live Scraper (Advanced Mode)**

- Fully implemented `DelhiHighCourtScraper` interacts with the live court website.
- Can be activated by setting `USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=False` in `app.py`.

#### **Strategy:**

- **Browser Automation:** Uses Selenium WebDriver to launch a real (headless) Chrome browser, mimicking user interactions.
- **Image Processing:** Locates the CAPTCHA, takes a screenshot, and uses OpenCV to pre-process the image for clarity.
- **OCR with Tesseract:** Passes the cleaned image to Tesseract OCR to recognize the CAPTCHA.
- **Automated Submission & Retries:** Submits recognized text, retries on failure.

#### **Limitations:**

Modern sites like the Delhi High Court use sophisticated anti-bot measures.  
While the live scraper is technically sound, it may still be blocked.  
The project defaults to mock mode for reliable demonstration, but the live scraper is included to showcase technical capabilities.

## üîí Security Considerations

- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Flask `SECRET_KEY` is loaded from environment variables.
- **Input Validation:** All user input is validated in `app.py`.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** `database.py` uses parameterized queries (`?`) to prevent SQL injection.
