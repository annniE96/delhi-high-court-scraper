## üîß Environment Variables

For best practice, create a `.env` file in the root directory to manage configuration.  
*(Not required to run, but recommended for production use)*

```
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-strong-and-random-secret-key

# Scraping Configuration
# Set to "False" to enable the live scraper, "True" for mock data (default)
USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=True
```

## üõ°Ô∏è CAPTCHA Handling Strategy

The application includes a dual-scraper system designed for reliability and robust handling of website challenges.

### 1. Mock Scraper (Default Mode)
- **Purpose:** Provides stability and speed for development and demos.
- **How it works:** Reads from a predefined set of realistic case data in `sample_data.py`, ensuring the UI and all features are testable without hitting the live website.

### 2. Live Scraper with OCR (Advanced Mode)
- **Purpose:** Interacts with the live court website, handling dynamic challenges like CAPTCHAs.
- **Activation:** Set `USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=False` in `app.py`.
- **Strategy:**
  - *Image Processing:* Downloads the CAPTCHA image, converts it to grayscale and enhances contrast using Pillow.
  - *OCR with Tesseract:* Uses pytesseract to recognize the CAPTCHA text.
  - *Form Submission:* Submits the recognized text and case details.
  - *Error Handling:* Provides clear error messages if CAPTCHA fails or case is not found.

## üîí Security Considerations

- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** The Flask `SECRET_KEY` should be managed securely, preferably via environment variables or a `.env` file.
- **Sensitive Data:** Do not commit sensitive keys or credentials to your repository.
