Create required directories:

# This command works on macOS/Linux. On Windows, create the folders manually.
mkdir -p templates static data

Run the application:

python app.py

Open your browser: Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000

üîß Environment Variables
For production, it is recommended to create a .env file in the root directory:

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-strong-secret-key

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_PATH=data/court_data.db

# Scraping Configuration
# Set to "False" to enable the live scraper
USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=True

üõ°Ô∏è CAPTCHA Handling Strategy
The application includes a dual-scraper system to ensure reliability and demonstrate a robust approach to handling website challenges.

1. Mock Scraper (Default)
Purpose: Provides a stable and fast experience for development and demonstration.

How it works: Reads from a predefined set of realistic case data in sample_data.py. This guarantees the UI and all application features can be tested without hitting the live website.

2. Live Scraper with OCR
Purpose: To interact with the live court website and handle dynamic challenges like CAPTCHAs.

Activation: Set USE_MOCK_SCRAPER=False in app.py.

Strategy:

Image Processing: The scraper downloads the CAPTCHA image and uses the Pillow library to convert it to grayscale and enhance its contrast, making it easier to read.

OCR with Tesseract: The processed image is passed to the Tesseract OCR engine via the pytesseract library. Tesseract attempts to recognize the characters in the image.

Form Submission: The recognized text is then submitted along with the case details in the search form.

Error Handling: If the CAPTCHA fails or the case is not found, the system provides a clear error message to the user.

üîí Security Considerations
No Hardcoded Secrets: The Flask SECRET_KEY is loaded from environment variables, not written in the code.

Input Validation: User input from the search form is validated
